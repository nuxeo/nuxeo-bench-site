## Analyze
This benchmark is done with both optimization:

- Audit optimization [NXP-17934](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXP-17934)
- Fulltext updater [NXP-17862](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXP-17862)

Theses optimizaton reduce async processing duration from 7x to 11x.

The gain comes mostly from the ft updater refactoring and 30% from audit refactoring.

The total benchmark duration is shorter from ~1h15 to 41min.
