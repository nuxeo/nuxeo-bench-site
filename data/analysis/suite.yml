"Nuxeo 8.1": "**Import**


- The nuxeo-importer is run on a single node so the synchronous part do not benefit of having multiple Nuxeo node.
  The limitation is mostly Nuxeo CPU at the begining then Nuxeo CPU + Nuxeo disk IO + CPU Backend.


- The asynchronous part scale with the number of node, more async activities impacts the synchronous part which
  explain sync thoughput decrease when adding Nuxeo nodes.
  The limitation is mostly due to [fulltext updater](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXP-17862).


**Create/Update**


- For synchronous part the limitation moves to the backend once there are 2 Nuxeo nodes.


**Navigation**


- This scales with the number of Nuxeo nodes. The limitation is on Nuxeo CPU and backend response time.


**CRUD**


- There are some randomness in the result here because the async time is incorrect [due to a bug|https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXP-19092]


**Reindex**


- Limited by backend except for MongoDB where the limitation is Elasticsearch.
