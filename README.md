# Nuxeo Benchmark Reference Site

This is the reference benchmark static site: https://benchmarks.nuxeo.com/

The site is generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

Benchmarks are run by the continuous integration (Jenkins) and commit the results as new content and data to this repository.

Commit to this repository trigger another job to build and publish the site to a S3 bucket, this s3 bucket is exposed as the reference benchmark site by CloudFront.

The site can be edited locally using Hugo, from this repository once you have installed Hugo:

```bash
hugo serve -t hyde --disableFastRender
```

Then go to http://localhost:1313/

Note that the git repo only contains the layout and a minimal information per benchmark result (a markdown + yaml files).
The detailed reports like Gatling reports or monitoring are saved in another S3 bucket, out of the git repository.

## Styling

To take advantage of standard Nuxeo styling, we use SCSS.

```bash
npx sass --style=compressed assets/scss/:themes/hyde/static/css/dist/
```

For development, the source can be watched

```bash
npx sass --watch assets/scss/:themes/hyde/static/css/dist/
```
