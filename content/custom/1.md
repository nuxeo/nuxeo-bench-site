## Overview
 
 ![alt text](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/nuxeo-b10b-results/160922-1213_2nuxeo-c3.4xlarge_7mongo-m3.xlarge_3es-i2.2xlarge/b10b-1b-header.png)
 
 This benchmark target is to load 1 billion documents and then run the classical Gatling benchmark on it.

 The database is a MongoDB sharded cluster using 7 nodes with a total of 28 CPUs.

 Elasticsearch 2.4 is setup with a cluster of 3 nodes with a total of 24 CPUs.
 
 Nuxeo 8.4-SNAPSHOT uses 2 nodes with a total of 32 CPUs.
 
 The ansible scripts that run this benchmark and the server tuning are described here: https://github.com/bdelbosc/b10bpoc/blob/shard/README.md 


## Mass import

  The import is done using 2 Nuxeo nodes running the nuxeo-importer plugin to generate random document.
   
  Import has been splitted in 2 executions because of a bug in the nuxeo importer that stop the import too early. 

  It has taken 8h30min to reach 1b documents, so an average of **32680 docs/s** with peak at **40400 docs/s**.
  
  Reporting this to the number of MongoDB vCPU it gives **1170 docs/s per vCPU**.

  The MongoDB storage size is 379.3GiB (including 155GiB for the 18 indexes) over 7 nodes, the average document size is 816 bytes.
   
## Elasticsearch indexing

  Indexing has been run in one shot, during 14h53min, so an average of **18660 docs/s** with peak at **27400 docs/s**.
  
  Reporting this to the number of Elasticsearch vCPU it gives **777 docs/s per vCPU**.

  The Elasticsearch storage size is 804GiB on 3 nodes with a total of 9 shards without replication.
